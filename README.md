# persistence-detector

Many programs run automatically at system startup. 

We call these persistent auto-start executables.

While persistent executables can be useful, they can also be used by malware to maintain long term access to a compromised system. 

Persistence Detector is a tool for detecting persistent auto-start programs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. 

This information empowers users to identify, detect, and remove unwanted persistent programs from their systems.

This program was created in 5 days as part of Dakota State University's [CSC 842 Security Tool Development](https://catalog.dsu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=12025) class.
